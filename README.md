## 👋 **Welcome to my CS106B Journey**

This repository documents my work in **CS106B: Programming Abstractions**, following the **Autumn curriculum** from Stanford University. This course focuses on data abstraction, recursion, and algorithmic thinking.

### 🎓 **Context & Motivation**
I am currently an undergraduate student in **Data Management at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI)**. As a neurodivergent learner who thrives on structure, I designed a rigorous **self-directed curriculum** based on Stanford's Computer Science BS requirements.

I use this roadmap to run parallel to my formal degree, allowing me to:
1.  Deepen my theoretical understanding of Computer Science.
2.  Challenge myself with complex problem-sets.
3.  Document my learning process transparently.

> **Note:** *I am not an enrolled student at Stanford University.* This is a personal project fueled by curiosity and discipline, adapting OpenCourseWare materials to reinforce my official academic journey.

## 🚀 **About This Repository**

Moving on from the basics of [programming logic with python in CS106A](https://github.com/codeonthespectrum/code-in-place), CS106B dives into the "engine room" of computer science. Here, I am transitioning from Python to **C++**, learning how to manage memory, design efficient data structures, and solve problems recursively.

You will find two main types of content here:

1.  **📂 Assignments:** My code solutions for the course assignments and labs.
2.  **📓 Learning Journal:** Detailed documentation of concepts, algorithms, and "aha!" moments.
